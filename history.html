        <p class = "title">Ancient Period</p>
        <p class="content">Astronomy in ancient history was more rudimentary due to the fact that they could only observe with the naked eye and not with tools like telescopes. The study of the stars during this time was to help determine the seasons to help with harvesting crops. Despite how limited their ability to observe the sky was, they still made major discoveries within this time period like the curvature/circumference of the earth by Eratosthenes. They also had made a lot of theories at this time like the models of the solar system, Geocentric meaning the earth is at the center of the solar system and Heliocentric, where the sun is at the center of the solar system. Of all of ancient astronomy, the most impressive achievement has to be the Antikythera mechanism, the earliest example of an analog computer in history that is theorized to have helped predict eclipses.

        <p class = "title">Middle Ages</p>
        <p class="content">The Middle Ages had many discoveries made within it such as the earth's rotation and the predecessor to the modern idea of inertia. Technological developments have also been made during this time like astronomical clocks, the rectangulus and the Albion.During this time period however it wasnt Europe that pushed the field forward the most but the Islamic world. They discovered the Andromeda Galaxy and they bore witness to the SN 1006 supernova, the brightest stellar event in history.

        <p class = "title">Renaissance</p>
        <p class="content">The Renaissance, being one of the most intellectually based eras, sparked a new age of scientific reasoning within europe. Many more tools and discoveries were made within this time frame such as the finalization of the Heliocentric model by Nicholas Copernicus. There is also the invention of the telescope which helped lead to more cataloging of stars and space objects. This culminated in the discovery of Uranus, the first planet that had to be searched for actively.

        <p class = "title">Post Renaissance</p>
        <p class="content">In this frame of reference, we gained more of an understanding of the world like the movement of the moon and the planets. Also with the invention of the spectroscope, a device that measures the properties of light, and astrophotography, we learned more about what stars really were. The milky-way and galaxies are finally proven to be real proper things which also lead to the theory about universal expansion, the idea that the universe is forever expanding and growing. We also have one of the first prominent female astronomers in Annie Jump Cannon who cataloged nearly 350000 different space objects and even has an award named after her. The last major theory proposed in this time is the theory of the Big Bang, something we had evidence for even back in the early 20th century

        <p class = "title">Modern Times</p>
          <p class="content">In modern times, we had the space race which led to the development of many technologies such as spacecraft and satellites. We have a more theoretical approach to astronomy than ever before with thinkers like Stephan Hawking leading to discussions on black holes and neutron stars. We have invented newer more advanced telescopes like the Hubble telescope which allows us to see the universe in a way never before. Astrophysics starts to take hold with figures like Carl Sagen and Neil Degrass Tyson helping to teach the average person more about space and what's in it. As well, with all the progress with computing made over the years, we have been running multiple different simulations of the universe with these computers to try to gain as much data about the universe as possible.
