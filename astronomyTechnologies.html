        <p class = "content">Companies like SpaceX, Boeing and Sierra Nevada Corporation are currently working on building spaceships that will travel to outer orbit. One of SpaceX’s most recent projects is developing a spaceship known as ‘Starship’. The purpose of the Starship is to carry humans, massive amounts of equipment and supplies to the moon and if possible, Mars. SpaceX has helped NASA save money by lowering the cost of flights to space through ‘reusable stages and fairings’. They are currently trying to create a fully reusable rocket system so it can be flown more often. One of the main reasons for the creation of the Starship is due to Elon Musk stating that the “holy grail” of making humans a multiplanetary species will all depend on creating a reusable rocket system with the ability to carry many items into space.
        </p>
	      <p class = "content"> Another company, Boeing, has partnered with NASA to create the CST-100 starliner. This spacecraft capsule is designed to be reusable up to 10 times and has wireless internet connectivity. It is capable of carrying either 7 passengers on the ship or a combination of crew and cargo for missions to the lower orbit of the Earth. The CST-100 Starliner is currently still being tested and is set to have another flight test in May 2022. The Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) is currently developing a new spacecraft called the Dream Chaser. It is designed to be a utility spacecraft that is able to transport equipment and passengers to the International Space Station (ISS). The Dream Chaser will be a reusable spacecraft that has the capability to do multiple missions.
        </p>
	      <p class = "content">All of the spacecrafts mentioned above are extremely useful as they will help satellites get into the Earth’s orbits and they also can transport items into outer space. With more satellites going out into space, it makes it easier for us to observe both outer space and the Earth for research purposes.

    <p class = "content">Spaceships allow humans to travel into the upper atmosphere. With the ability to go to space we have been able to conduct many experiments and tests about the effects of zero gravity. This has led to the discovery that crystals grow larger in a zero gravity environment and those crystals can be used to create new drugs. In fact, a lot of medical discoveries have been made while in space when it comes to certain diseases.

        <p class = "content">SpaceX uses the Starship to launch a satellite called Starlink. The Starship efficiently sends and launches satellites further into space so that they’re able to potentially orbit the medium or high Earth orbits rather than the low-earth orbit. Starship plans for satellites to be able to create and expand for more missions. Starlink is focused on trying to connect its network to moving vehicles such as aircraft ships, large trucks and RVs. Currently, Starlink is being used to enable the usage of high data rate activities such as streaming, gaming and video calls. Elon Musk believes that having 42 200 Starlink satellites would enable the entire world access to high-speed internet and low latency. The cost for every launch of these satellites is lower than the SpaceX Falcon Vehicles, so the thought of 42 200 satellites wouldn’t be so unrealistic.
        </p>
	      <p class = "content"> A company called Lockheed Martin Space is currently working with NASA to create more satellites. They have recently developed on-orbit docking through the technology of open-source satellite interface. With an open-source satellite interface, satellites will be able to get more frequent updates and upgrades. This will help keep the satellites up to date. Lockheed satellites are extremely helpful to us as they provide GPS directions and a forecast of different types of weather conditions. Currently, other satellites are using 20 or 30 year old technology and there is no way to update them in orbit. A solution to this problem is to buy smaller satellites that will be launched more frequently, yet are also quick to be disposed of. This solution doesn’t always work, since some missions require larger satellites. Deploying the Lockheed satellites will solve both of these problems, as they are reusable and have an open-source interface.

    <p class = "content">With the invention of satellites during the space race, we have used satellites in many ways to better and improve our world. It has resulted in the transfer of data from one to many locations and the ability for people to communicate over the internet. We also use them to study the weather like storms and the ecosystems of our planet.

        <p class = "content">The James Webb Space telescope is one of the most powerful telescopes to ever be created. It is said to be much more powerful than the hubble telescope. The James Webb telescope is an infrared observatory telescope that has great sensitivity and longer wavelengths. Its primary mirror is about 6.5m. This telescope orbits the sun at L2 (the second Lagrange point), which is approximately 1.5 million km from the Earth. The purpose of the James Webb telescope is to uncover the undiscovered parts of the universe and research more about the history of the universe. It will also study about our solar system and also study different solar systems along with uncovering distant worlds. With the help of the James Webb telescope, astronomers might be able to find other life forms on other planets. This telescope will enable humans to see and learn about things we’ve never seen before.

    <p class = "content">The major effect of telescopes on the modern world is the discovery of many space objects by the hubble telescope and the photos we have been able to take of said objects. One of the most impressive photos ever taken was the photograph of a black hole, which was done using a multi-array of smaller telescopes. As well, telescopes are the most publicly available type of technology out of the three we cover, showing people to participate in some amature astronomy.
