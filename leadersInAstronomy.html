                  <p class="content">Eratosthenes was born C. 276 BCE in Cyrene, which is now known as Libya in North Africa. He was taught by many teachers such as a scholar and poet named Callimachus, a scholar named Lysanias of Cyrene and a philosopher named Ariston of Chios. With all these teachers, Eratosthenes spent a great deal of time studying in Athens. During this time, the great library at Alexandria had been built with the help of Ptolemy II Philadelphus. Callimachus, Eratosthenes’ mentor, was appointed as the second librarian of the library. In 245 BC, Ptolemy III succeeded his father (Ptolemy II Philadelphus) and he convinced Eratosthenes to travel to Alexandria to tutor his son, Philaptor. In 240 BC, Eratosthenes was appointed as the third Librarian at Alexandria after Callimachus’ death. Eratosthene accomplished many different things before his death in 194 BC, which is said to have been caused by voluntary starvation.

                  <p class="content">Eratosthenes wrote an algorithm called the Sieve of Eratosthenes which is for finding prime numbers. Natural numbers are arranged in numerical order and one is crossed out, then every second number after two, every third number after three, etc. The numbers that were not crossed out are the prime numbers. Eratosthenes had written many works, including poems that were about astronomy, ethics and theater. However, his only surviving work is a book called Catasterisms, which is about constellations. Every constellation recorded in his book has a description, story as well as the amount of stars it contains. Eratosthenes was also able to accurately assume the Sun’s distance from Earth was extremely great. He also estimated the circumference of the Earth based on the distance between two parallel rays from the sun. The measurement he got was 250 000 stadia, which is about 46 250km. Nowadays, we know that the measured circumference is about 40 075 km, so Eratosthenes wasn’t far off.

                   <p class="content">Known as the father of modern astronomy, Nicolaus Copernicus was a well-known figure in astronomy history. He was born on February 19th, 1473 in a city called Torun (which is located in North-Central Poland). Nicolaus was born into a family of merchants, and he lived with his father, Nicolaus, his mother, Barbara Watzenrode, and three older siblings. When his father died sometime between 1483-1485, Nicolaus was taken in by Lucas Watzenrode, his uncle. His uncle was an upcoming bishop of the cathedral chapter of Warmia and he raised Nicolaus to be a future church canon. In 1491-1494, Nicolaus went to the University of Krakow to study liberal arts, his courses including astronomy and astrology. Afterwards, like many of his peers, he traveled to Italy to resume his studies at the University of Bologna, where his Uncle received a doctorate in canon law in 1473. During his stay in Italy, he lived with Domenico Maria de Novara, who was the principal astronomer at the University of Bologna. Novara was responsible for announcing annual astrological predictions. His predictions were open to all social classes, but he mainly focused on the fates of their enemies and the Italian princes. Copernicus was a witness of Novara observations, and he even assisted in some of the forecasts. Novara taught Copernicus about the criticism of  astrology regarding the Ptolemaic system, which assumed that the Earth was in the center of the universe.
                </p>
                <p class = "content"> Later on, Copernicus studied at the University of Padua and the University of Ferrara. In 1503, he received a doctorate in canon law from the University of Ferrara. After his studies, he returned to Poland and became a church administrator who would use his free time to research about different topics including astronomy. Nicolaus Copernicus wrote a book called “Six books concerning the revolutions of the Heavenly Orbs”. In this book, he argues that Earth and the other planets revolve around the Sun, which contradicts the Ptolemaic system that assumed Earth was the center of the universe and stays stationary. This discovery helped him and others make astounding discoveries. Nicolaus was able to determine the orbital periods of all the planets and their order from the Sun, and his estimates were seemingly accurate. He states that the earth spins on its axis daily and it takes approximately 1 year to orbit around the Sun.

            <div class = "scrollable-content">
              <p class="content">Annie Jump Cannon was born on December 11th, 1863 in Dover, Delaware. Her father, Wilson Cannon, was a Delaware state senator. Her mother, Mary Jump, told Annie all about constellations when she was a little girl which sparked her interest in astronomy. Annie attended Wellesley college for physics and astronomy and graduated in 1884 as the Valedictorian of her class. Afterwards, she returned to Delaware and began to focus on photography and music. In 1894, Annie returned to Wellesley to pursue advanced studies of astronomy, then went to Radcliffe college in 1895. She became an assistant of Edward C. Pickering in 1896. Pickering was the director of the Harvard college observatory. She worked alongside Williamina P.S. Fleming and Antonia Maury, and this group was known as “Pickering’s Women”. They all worked together on Pickering’s ambitious project, where they classified countless stars.
              </p>
              <p class="content">Annie was able to record and organize the spectra of all stars up to the ninth magnitude. Annie simplified Fleming’s classes of A-Q down to O, B, A, F, G, K and M. She reclassified P to planetary nebulae and Q for unusual stars. Annie included numerical divisions and divided them in steps from 0 to 9. People figured out that she was classifying stars based on their temperature, and her method became universally adopted. Annie continued on and classified spectra for more than 225 000 stars. Nine volumes were created of her work and it was published as the Henry Draper catalogue. In 1911, she was appointed as the Curator of Observational Photographs at the Harvard Observatory. After 1924, she continued her work and categorized tens of thousands of stars all the way to the 11th magnitude. This work was published in the two-volume Henry Draper Extension. Annie was given many awards like a honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford in 1925 and Henry Draper Medal of the National Academy of Sciences in 1931. She established an award in the American Astronomical Society after being the first woman to become an officer in that organization. Her award is called the Annie Jump Cannon award.

              <div class = "person-title">Charles Messier</div>
              <div class = "scrollable-content">
                <p class="content">Charles Messier was born on June 26th, 1730 in Badonviller, France. He was born into a wealthy family and lived a comfortable life until his father died when he was 11 years old. His family’s financial state changed drastically, and Charles became homeschooled by his older brother. In 1744, Charles witnessed the appearance of an amazing comet, which sparked his interest in astronomy. In 1751, he traveled to Paris and became a draftsman for an astronomer named Joseph Delisle (who held the position of the astronomer of the French Navy). During his time as a draftsman, Charles would record observations of the heavens.
                </p>
                <p class = "content">In 1758, he noticed that there was a strange patch in the Taurus constellation. Intrigued, he decided to continue observing it, and concluded that it was not a comet because it was stationary. In 1760, he created a list of nebulae called “Messier’s Catalogue” which would help other astronomers differentiate between nebulae and comets. His first entry talked about the one he found in the Taurus constellation, labeling it as the Crab Nebula.  Most of the nebulae he found by himself, while some of them were added by other astronomers. By 1784, there was a total of 109 objects added to the list. A British astronomer named Kenneth Glyn Jones added one more satellite galaxy to the list. In total, the Messier Catalogue contains 110 star clusters, galaxies and nebulae. To this day, his list is still very helpful to amateur astronomers.
